# Remark

Besides my on work, some examples and text in this notebooks were adapted from several works. Hoping to remember them all, here is a list:

- Romano, F., Phillips, D., & van Hattem, R. (2016). Python: Journey from Novice to Expert. Packt Publishing Ltd.
- Borges, L. E. (2014). Python para Desenvolvedores. 1ª edição. Rio de Janeiro: Editora Novatec. (in Portuguese)
- Beazley, D. (2019). http://www.dabeaz.com/ (accessed in 2019-02-28) 

If some one feels that it should be mentioned in this list, please tell me!
